# INT375-CA2

I recently explored and visualized hospital data using Python, diving into a dataset containing general information about over 5,000 hospitals across the U.S. The project involved data cleaning using pandas (handling missing values with dropna, fillna, forward and backward fill methods), and saving a cleaned version for further analysis. I then visualized key insights with matplotlib and seaborn: from ZIP code distributions and top states by hospital count, to scatter plots comparing emergency services with overall hospital ratings, and boxplots grouped by ownership type. A line plot highlighted average ratings across the top 10 states, and a correlation heatmap revealed relationships between numeric variables. To strengthen the analysis, I ran a T-test comparing hospital ratings with/without emergency services, and a Chi-square test to assess the association between ownership types and emergency services. This project enhanced my skills in EDA, statistical testing, and storytelling with data â€” a crucial part of impactful data science! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
